# jtalk
FH project for an awesome chat client!

How it works: 
The app supports an unlimited number of users. However, for now, only users found in users.txt are allowed. The signup method is not implemented, yet. Also, the ip address in users.txt has no meaning as of now.

On startup, the app can be run as client or server. For the latter, just click on "Run as server" and hit start. There is an appropriate feedback that this instance is run as server, so far. In order to work properly, one instance has to run as server. You can then uncheck "Run as server" and login to the app with the dummy credentials provided in users.txt. It is also possible and recommended to start new instances of the app. 

Feel free to add new users in users.txt. Please note that there is a delay of 3 seconds once you've logged in before you see the chat window.

Have fun!
